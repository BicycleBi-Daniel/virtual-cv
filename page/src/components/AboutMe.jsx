          <p className="about-body">
            I am a Business Intelligence Consultant with nearly 10 years of experience across the full BI development lifecycle, including data warehousing, ETL, dashboarding, and SQL. Known for delivering practical, insight-driven solutions and progressing rapidly into leadership roles. Certified in MicroStrategy and Pyramid Analytics, with a strong focus on aligning project outcomes with business objectives.
          </p>
          <p className="about-body">
            Iâ€™m a patient and thorough learner with a deep respect for detail. I thrive in environments where I can stick around, grow, and excel, both technically and personally. My creative touch and ability to apply abstract thinking often help me see patterns and possibilities others might miss.
