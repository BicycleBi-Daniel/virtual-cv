1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

## Structure
- Components are in 'src/components/'

## UI Overview

I tried to have a cleaner more modern look to my cv with these sections with a bar menu and a color scheme of black and some brown

	includes parts that gives a bit of a bio, education and a summary of work experience.
